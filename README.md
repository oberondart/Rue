# Rue
Simple neural network architecture built in Ruby using the neural-net-ruby module 

See at https://github.com/gbuesing/neural-net-ruby/tree/master

Consists of multiple neural networks to create an architecture that can handle tasks from simple XOR to text processing, via the usage of modern technique and algorithms to maximize efficeny and simiplisity.
